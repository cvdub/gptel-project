#+TITLE: gptel-project

The goal of this package is to replicate the "projects" feature of the default ChatGPT client in Emacs with [[https://github.com/karthink/gptel][gptel]]. It enables project-based context, transcripts, and summaries, leveraging Emacs' built in ~project.el~.

Project based chats are automatically saved to a project sub-directory, and a project summary is created/updated from these chats. You can also define a project description which is included in the system prompt.

Autosaving of project chats and automatic updating of the project summary can be disabled by customizing ~gptel-project-autosave-chat-transcripts~ and ~gptel-project-automatically-update-summary~.
